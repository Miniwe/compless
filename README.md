Compless [![[Build Status]](https://travis-ci.org/neoascetic/compless.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/neoascetic/compless)
=============================================

**It's like [compass][], but for [less][]**

Mixins are divided into categories in a way how it done in the compass'
[reference][]. See sources to find what is already implemented.

To start using this set, simply extract an [archive][] into folder where your
less files lie, rename extracted directory to `compless` and put
`@import "compless/all"` on the top of your stylesheet.

The main purpose of this project is to give a developer mixins set similar to
[compass' one][reference]. So, if you want to create a pull request, make sure
that new functionality as similar to compass' analogues as possible.
